This tool was developed by the team who made MCW wallet ([trusted by 1000+ webmasters](https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064)). We use uniswap.org sources with small changes, you can check the sources of smartcontract after deployment then compare it with the verified uniswap's contracts. We don't have access to the pools. We do our best to prevent all damages to our users, anywayг use this software at your own risk. Join Our Discord https://discord.gg/Nhgfdkvemz
